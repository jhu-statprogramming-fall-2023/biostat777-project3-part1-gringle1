## Introduction

We illustrate use of the **rpart** package using data from Freedom House and the United Nations to investigate the relationship between the civil liberty ranking and political rights rankings related to freedom status ("Free","Not free",and "Partially Free")? 

Note that "Freedom status" is not meant to be used here a definitive measure. This system is a likely a vast over-simplication of the nuances of freedom, liberty and political climate. The data is used here to explore how these designations were created using **rpart**.

Data and data dictionary are available at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-02-22/readme.md 


## Set up 

### Load packages

First we load the rpart package. 

If `rpart` is not installed, install via:  

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rpart")
```

```{r}
library(rpart)
```

Additional packages used are:

```{r}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(maps)
```

### Download data 

```{r message=FALSE}
if (!(file.exists(here("vignettes","data")))) {
  dir.create(here("vignettes","data"))
  if (!(file.exists(here("vignettes","data","freedom.rds")))) {
     tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2022, week = 8)

      freedom <- tuesdata$freedom
     saveRDS(freedom,here("vignettes","data","freedom.rds"))
  }
} else {
   freedom <- readRDS(here("vignettes","data","freedom.rds"))
}

```

The data set spans 26 years and consists of 193 countries.

```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
head(freedom)
freedom %>% pull(year) %>% unique() %>% length()
freedom %>% pull(country) %>% unique() %>% length()
freedom %>% pull(Region_Name) %>% unique()
```

## Data exploration

Plotting country freedom status, we can see that many countries in North America, Europe, South and western South America, Southern Africa, and Australia are classified as "Free". Many African, west Asian, and eastern European counties are classified "Not free". 

```{r,class.source = 'fold-hide'}

world_map <- map_data("world")

freedom_2020_plot <- freedom  %>% 
  filter(year==2020) %>%
   mutate(region=case_when(
     country=="United States of America" ~ "USA",
     grepl("Kingdom",country) ~ "UK",
     grepl("Antigua",country) ~ "Antigua",
     grepl("Bolivia",country) ~ "Bolivia",
     grepl("Iran",country) ~ "Iran",
     grepl("Lao",country) ~ "Laos",
     country=="Democratic People's Republic of Korea" ~ "North Korea",
     country=="Republic of Korea" ~ "South Korea",
     country=="Viet Nam" ~ "Vietnam",
     country=="Czechia" ~ "Czech Republic",
     country=="Cabo Verde" ~ "Cape Verde",
     country=="Congo" ~ "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
     grepl("Russia",country) ~ "Russia",
     grepl("Venezuela",country) ~ "Venezuela",
     grepl("Brunei",country) ~ "Brunei",
     grepl("Tanzania",country) ~ "Tanzania",
     country=="Syrian Arab Republic" ~ "Syria",
     country=="Republic of Moldova" ~ "Moldova",
     country=="CÃƒÂ´te dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ivoire"~ "Ivory Coast",
     TRUE ~ country)) %>% select(region,Status)

world_map <- world_map  %>% left_join(freedom_2020_plot,by="region")

distinct(world_map, region,Status) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill=Status,map_id = region)) +
  geom_map(map = world_map) +
  theme_bw() + 
  expand_limits(x = world_map$long, y = world_map$lat) + 
  ylab("Latitude") + 
  xlab("Longitude") + 
  labs(title="Countries by freedom status",
       caption="Data comes from Freedom House via TidyTuesday")  +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = -1,
                       end=.8,
                       option = "plasma",
                       breaks=c("F","PF","NF"),
                       labels=c("Free","Partially Free","Not free"))
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
#freedom_2020_plot %>% anti_join(world_map,by="region")
#world_map %>% filter(grepl("Ivor",region)) %>% pull(region) %>% unique()
```


Plotting the distribution of the political freedom ranking and civil liberties rankings as well as the average of the two, we see that freedom status is almost entirely determined by the average of the two. Higher scores on these measures correspond to less "Freedom".

```{r class.source = 'fold-hide'}

df <- freedom %>%
  mutate(PR_CL = (PR + CL)/2)


value_labs<-c("CL"="Civil Liberties (CL)","PR"="Political Freedom (PR)","PR_CL"="Avg. of CL and PF (PR_CL)")
df %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(CL,PR,PR_CL)) %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x=value,fill=Status)) + facet_grid(cols=vars(name),scale="free_x",labeller=labeller(name=value_labs)) +   xlab("") + 
  theme_bw() + 

  scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = -1,
                       end=.8,
                       option = "plasma",
                       breaks=c("F","PF","NF"),
                       labels=c("Free","Partially Free","Not free"))
```
## Using `rpart`

### Initial model 

Now we use `rpart` to fit a classification tree using CL and PR as predictors. 
```{r}
rpart_mod <- rpart(method = "class",Status~ CL + PR + PR_CL, data=df)
```

We can use the `plot` method to visualize the tree, and see that indeed the two splits correspond to what we see in the data above. Note that the average will be in 0.5 units ranging from 0.5 to 7, as the two scores are integers 1-7. Our model is the following: when the average of political freedom and civil liberties is between 0.5-2.5, the country is classified as "Free". When is 3-5, they are classified as "Partially free". When it is 5.5 or greater, they are classified as "Not free"

```{r}
plot(rpart_mod,margin=.05)
text(rpart_mod)
```

Finally we can visualize our model by plotting the data with the decision boundaries as fit by the rpart model, which are based entirely on the average of PR and CL. For example, the points with $\frac{(CL + PR)}/{2} < 2.75$ is  We can also get the predicted status from the rpart model using the predict function. 

```{r class.source = 'fold-hide' }

df %>% 
  group_by(CL,PR,Status) %>%
  summarize(N=n()) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x=CL,y=PR,colour=Status,size = N),alpha=.5) +
  theme_bw() + 
  geom_abline(intercept=2*2.75,slope=-1,linetype="dashed") + 
  geom_abline(intercept=2*5.25,slope=-1,linetype="dotted") + 
  ylab("Political freedom (PR)") +
  xlab("Civil liberties (CL)") + 
  labs(title="Freedom status by PR and CL",subtitle="with rpart decision boundaries",
       caption=str_wrap("Below the dashed line: classified by the model as free; above the dotted line: not free; in-between:partially free.")) + 
  scale_colour_viridis_d(direction = -1,
                       end=.8,
                       option = "plasma",
                       breaks=c("F","PF","NF"),
                       labels=c("Free","Partially Free","Not free"))


```

From this analysis we can confirm that the freedom status is based primarily on the average of the political and civil liberty scores. We can get the predictions from the model using `predict.rpart` and see that we have an accuracy of 99.6% with only 21 missclassified counties.

### Stratified by year

However, as the model is not entirely perfect, it is possible that additional predictors are used or that the models may have differed over time. We will try fitting rpart trees stratified by year.

```{r}

df_pred <- df %>%  mutate(rpart_pred = predict(rpart_mod,type="class"),
               correct=case_when(rpart_pred==Status~ Status,
                                 TRUE ~ "Incorrect"))

accuracy <- sum(df_pred$correct!="Incorrect")/nrow(df_pred)


preds_by_year <- df_pred %>%  split(df_pred$year) %>% purrr::map(\(df) rpart(Status ~ PR_CL, data = df)) %>% 
  purrr::map_dbl(\(model) sum(as.integer(predict(model,type="class")) ==model$y)/length(model$y))

plot(names(preds_by_year),preds_by_year,ylab="Accuracy",xlab="Year")
```

All years after 2002 have 100% accuracy indicating that we have figured out how status is determined (either entirely or sufficiently well). However,in 2002 and earlier there is some level of missclassification. In order to figure out how status is determined in these years, we would have to dig deeper into the data or documentation.
